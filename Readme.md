There isn't much I can do right now.  I will be completing a Udemy (actually two) that helps build ps1 scripts.  This is important because I need to build a script that takes in a doc, convert the data into a format required for ingesting into another application.  When I say doc, I actually talking about multiple docs from different dirs.  Each doc might provide data in a dif format.  Also, the dates need to be manipulated to either add or subtract a day.  This means that the day must move to the next mont if it's adding a day to the last day of the month.  Finally, I need to create another script that lets us backfill files that we might need to grab again at a later date.  Can ps1 actually do that?

I'm trying to set up a cool powershell study repo.  This will be interesting in the very least.  Update: This actually did well.
