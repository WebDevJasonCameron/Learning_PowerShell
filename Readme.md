I completed more work on vars.  The main purpose of the challenge was to grab user inputs, grab the date, and then use those inputs to create the actual file name.  This was incredible.  It also was stuff they didn't teach.  The main focus in all the Udemy training is to look up everything through the `Get-Help` function.

## 2022 10 11 | PS1 Not Liking

I know PS1 is suppose to be amazing for Win users.  I don't like it.  It isn't a language to me.  It feels really exclusionary.  I also know, I need to understand this programming odity to fix some really fustrating things within the networks.  Going home to learn this is far from fun.  I'd rather be building some stuff with python, java or almost anything else.  I guess that's why I know this is probably the right thing to do.  I don't want to be doing it, LOL.

Most of the work in this will be done during work.  As such, I won't be able to send my stuff to Git

## 2022 10 07 | 2nd Day

There isn't much I can do right now.  I will be completing a Udemy (actually two) that helps build ps1 scripts.  This is important because I need to build a script that takes in a doc, convert the data into a format required for ingesting into another application.  When I say doc, I actually talking about multiple docs from different dirs.  Each doc might provide data in a dif format.  Also, the dates need to be manipulated to either add or subtract a day.  This means that the day must move to the next mont if it's adding a day to the last day of the month.  Finally, I need to create another script that lets us backfill files that we might need to grab again at a later date.  Can ps1 actually do that?

## 2022 10 06 | First Test

I'm trying to set up a cool powershell study repo.  This will be interesting in the very least.  Update: This actually did well.
